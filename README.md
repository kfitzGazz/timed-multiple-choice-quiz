# Timed Coding Quiz

## Description

I created this timed coding quiz to improve and display my javascript skills. I learned more about JS syntax and can help other coders in the future with creating simple quizzes. 

## Installation

Open with liveserver from VScode to test your coding knowledge and to see the functionality as you take the quiz and add your initials for high score.

## Usage

Anyone can use this as a basis to build a simple, timed quiz.

## Credits

Shout out to Phil for helping me debug how to get my choices to show during office hours.
